-- Setup --
The systems biology toolbox (http://www.sbtoolbox2.org/main.php) is necessary to run the scripts in this project.
It must be compiled and added to the MATLAB path before the scripts are run.

-- Simulating model and plotting corresponding figures -- 
To plot manuscript figures - Run the Run.m file and chosen witch figure to plot. This will initiate the corresponding model simulations and plot the figures. 
 
--
Code used for parameter estimation and analysis is aviable upon request.
